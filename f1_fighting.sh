# F1 Fighting Championship - A Simple Terminal RPG Game
# Version 0.1 - Alpha
# Created by OperaVaria
#
# This is a simple, comedic, RPG meme game with text adventure elements, centred
# around F1 fan rivalries that got a bit out of hand lately. The project  was
# created as a Bash scripting exercise (and skill showcase). Nothing in this game is meant to be
# taken seriously.
#
# As of now, the game is highly unbalanced, much optimization is needed.
#
# Mainly made with nano, with some work in Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code.
#
# Tested on Lubuntu 22.04 LTS, GNU bash 5.1.16(1)-release and
#           Windows 11 Pro version 23H2, GNU bash 5.2.21(1)-release.
# Should work in any Linux distribution's default terminal, or with Git Bash on Windows.
