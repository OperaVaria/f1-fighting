# F1 Fighting Championship #

This is a simple, comedic, RPG meme game with text adventure elements, centred around F1 fan rivalries that got a bit out of hand lately. The project was created as a Bash scripting exercise (and skill showcase). Nothing in this game is meant to be taken seriously.

Version 0.1 - Alpha

## Instructions ##

The game is a Bash script, it should run in any Linux distribution's default terminal, or on Windows with Git Bash.
